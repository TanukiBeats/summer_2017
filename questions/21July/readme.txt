I have two files:

panZoomDynamic.html and simplePanAndZoom.html

simplePanAndZoom.html is from an online source. It is an empty graph with pan and zoom functionality.

panZoomDynamic.html is from the book I was using and originally had no pan/zoomfunciontality. It has a dynamic dataset.

Anyways, I took the parts of simplePanAndZoom.html and tried to put them into panAndZoom.html to give it zooming functionality. However, the script seems to ignore it? When I put the new stuff it, the webpage acts the same as before. 

I added in lines 75-76 and 106-109.

I'm also not sure where in simplePanAndZoom.html gives the panning funcitonality.

Anyways I checked the functions and they match the official references.
