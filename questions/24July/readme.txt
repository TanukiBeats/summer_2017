The "notes.txt" file has questions (with the relevent code) for stuff I couldn't figure out about the "scatter.js"

These files are from an example zoom/pan d3 scatterplot which can be found at http://bl.ocks.org/peterssonjonas/4a0e7cb8d23231243e0e

I would recommend opening it in a separate page as there is a small button in the bottom left corner of the graph which can't be seen on the bl.ocks.org website window.
